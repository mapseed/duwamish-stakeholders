Thanks to the  actions of many partners including the Friends of the Hill, Forterra and  City of Tukwila, the property was purchased in 2004 and has been in  active restoration ever since. The Duwamish Hill Preserve serves as an  outdoor classroom for students, a gathering place for restoration  volunteers, a culturally significant location for Native Americans and  an example of a successful partnership between community members and  public and private partners.<br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span><strong>  \tCreation of the Preserve</strong>  \tIn 2001, Forterra, the City of Tukwila and local citizen group Friends  of the Hill formed a partnership to work towards the preservation of a  10.5 acre parcel slated for industrial development. The land was  successfully acquired in 2004 by the Forterra (then Cascade Land  Conservancy) and the City of Tukwila. In September 2010, after many  years of hard work by volunteers, the Duwamish Hill Preserve was  officially opened to the public. The preserve now includes an outdoor  classroom area, established trail and continued restoration  opportunities for volunteers. The Duwamish Hill Preserve is managed as a  public open space preserve dedicated to the conservation and  enhancement of its rich Native American cultural history, ecological  importance and community impact. Funding for acquisition and restoration  of this property has been supported by grants from many generous  contributors.<br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span><strong><br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span>  \tNatural and Cultural History </strong> \tDue to its elevated position above the Duwamish River, the Hill offered  a vantage point from which Native Americans could watch for incoming  groups and communicate with fellow tribe members along the Duwamish  River Valley. Additionally, the Hill is associated with the southern  Puget Sound Salish oral tradition as the key location in the stories  collectively known as the &ldquo;Epic of the Winds.&rdquo;<br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span>  \tThe hill from which the preserve gets its name is a glacial remnant and  within the preserve many species of flora and fauna that are rarely  seen along the banks of the Duwamish River can be found.<br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"\"\"></span><strong>  \tRestoration</strong>  \tThousands of volunteers have contributed countless hours of work  removing invasive weed and planting native trees and shrubs. The Friends  of the Hill make up a core group of dedicated volunteers that host  monthly restoration work parties at the Hill and offer local community  members a chance to contribute to the restoration of this amazing  preserve.

Heyer drift cell to assist in the recovery of salmonids and other important fish resources.  This drift system is among the most intact drift cells in the WRIA 9 Marine Nearshore Sub-basin.  It measures 2.2 miles in length and is characterized by minimal modifications and an eroding bluff backed beach.  Bluffs account for over 50% of this shorelines.  The backshore contains dense, mature native riparian vegetation.  Juvenile chinook, chum, coho, cutthroat, pink, sockeye and steelhead are known to be present along the eastern shoreline and termines along the large spit near the marsh inlet at Point Heyer.  Other important nearshore resources include a surf smelt spawning beach, and eelgrass, kelp and ulva along the intertidal/subtidal area. The tidal lagoon serves an important function in providing feeding, rearing and cover for migrating juvenile salmon.  This phase of the project focuses on shoreline throughout the drift cell, with the highest priority parcels being those with feeder bluffs. \n",

Three of the 27 parcels are already in public ownership (two owned by King County and one by the City of Normandy Park).  While the upland is not developed, there is a bulkhead along 80% of the shoreline of the bluff.  Once the parcels are purchased, the bulkhead would be removed to allow for natural sediment beach feeding processes to occur.  The restoration phase of this project is designated as a separate project, 09-NS-011B.",

This project improves a riparian corridor of Codiga Park for juvenile Chinook salmon habitat. The riparian area is approximately 2 acres and 1,000 linear feet. This area was cleared of invasive plant species in phases from 2008-2010 with the help of community volunteers and EarthCorps crews under People For Puget Sound's management. The area is currently being maintained and monitored by volunteers called Puget Sound Stewards who are managed by EarthCorps. Ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the still young native plants is anticipated for the next 5 years at minimum as long as there is funding and landowner support.",

Icy Creek is a year round spring fed stream with flows of 40-60 cubic feet per second. It has been classified as a source of clear, cold, pathogen-free water that feeds the Green River.  Chinook, coho, and steelhead spawn at the mouth of Icy Creek as it enters the Green River.  It also protects numerous spring that feed into the Green River. There are five or more springs that either directly flow into the Green River or flow into Icy Creek from the gorge walls below the Icy Creek uplands. ",

It also contains among the highest juvenile densities in the Duwamish. The site has been identified as important by every major habitat study of the Duwamish estuary since 1991.

The development of the park dates to 1926 with the dedication of the park with construction of the facilities, including a historic fire pit, by the Civilian Conservation Crews in the 1930's. More recent alterations include shoreline and streambank armoring to protect a shoreline trail, volleyball court, restroom and picnic facilities.  The restoration project will improve the lower portion of stream, pocket estuary, and nearshore damaged by the fill and shoreline armoring.",

There is a road that leads to and ends at the Puget Sound Energy property.  Since Puget Sound Energy would need the road to maintain the equipment on site, the bulkhead/culvert would be replaced with a box culvert and the road would be moved as far back from the shoreline as possible.  It is also possible that a new road crossing could be build onto the Puget Sound Energy property off of the adjacent King County property.  This would have the stream crossing occurring approximately 150 feet upstream of the mouth.  The northern half of the bulkhead, which is not protecting any structures or road, would be removed.  The stream mouth areas would be planted with riparian and marsh vegetation.",

Originally the OSP site was operated for petroleum storage and distribution. The fuel storage caused sediment contamination and required clean up prior to any other use of the area. After the site was cleaned up, SAM purchased the OSP site in 1999 with the intent to create a public space for art. At this time, SAM owned two upland parcels and one subtidal parcel, with the City of Seattle owning a right-of-way at the waterÃ¢ÂÂs edge. This presented a unique opportunity for SAM and the City of Seattle to collaborate and capitalize on the OSPÃ¢ÂÂs location along Elliott Bay. \n",

Two flapgates at the mouth would be replaced with  self-regulating tidegates to allow normal tidal flushing while reducing flooding on Riverton Creek during high flows in the Duwamish.Removal of the flapgates and associated creek restoration will restore and enhance salmonid habitat within Riverton Creek and improve its connection to the Duwamish River, using natural processes and habitat elements to facilitate upstream migration and to provide juvenile off-channel rearing.  This would be accomplished by restoring a more natural tidal connection between the Duwamish River and Riverton Creek, restablishing reliable fish access to Riverton Creek, and rehabilitating the existing channel to provide productive rearing and refuge habitat for salmonid species including juvenile Chinook salmon.\n",
