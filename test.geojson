Puget Sound Energy owns the property where Cove Creek enters Puget Sound through a bulkhead/culvert combination.  King County owns the two parcels upstream.  There is a road that leads to and ends at the Puget Sound Energy property.  Since Puget Sound Energy would need the road to maintain the equipment on site, the bulkhead/culvert would be replaced with a box culvert and the road would be moved as far back from the shoreline as possible.  It is also possible that a new road crossing could be build onto the Puget Sound Energy property off of the adjacent King County property.  This would have the stream crossing occurring approximately 150 feet upstream of the mouth.  The northern half of the bulkhead, which is not protecting any structures or road, would be removed.  The stream mouth areas would be planted with riparian and marsh vegetation.","LOCATION_LONGITUDE":"-122.5095","LOCATION_LATITUDE":"47.4543","LOCATION_LINK":"","UPLOAD_PHOTO":"","DOC_LINK":"","ORGANIZATIONS":"King Co Water & Land Res, WRIA 9 Lead Entity, King County - WLRD - Vashon-Maury Island Steward","CONTACT_EMAIL":"email@example.com","CONTACT_ORGANIZATION":"King County - WLRD - Vashon-Maury Island Steward","CONTACT_PHONE":"","CONTACT_WEBSITE":"http://waconnect.paladinpanoramic.com/project/250/7533","SOCIAL_LINK":"","DATA_ENTRY_NAME":"Green Duwamish Watershed","DATA_ENTRY_PHONE":"555-555-5555","PROJECT_DATE":"6/1/09","END_DATE":"6/20/15","DATE_NOTE":""},"geometry":null},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"PROJECT_NAME":"Shinglemill Creek Salmon Habitat Enhancement","PROJECT_TYPE":"River/stream/wetlands restoration/conservation/flood protection","PROJECT_TYPE_CODE":"7","PROJECT_DESCRIPTION":"The Vashon-Maury Island Land trust conducted a habitat enhancement project on Shinglemill Creek.
