Thanks to the  actions of many partners including the Friends of the Hill, Forterra and  City of Tukwila, the property was purchased in 2004 and has been in  active restoration ever since. The Duwamish Hill Preserve serves as an  outdoor classroom for students, a gathering place for restoration  volunteers, a culturally significant location for Native Americans and  an example of a successful partnership between community members and  public and private partners.<br /><span style=""""""""></span><br /><span style=""""""""></span><strong>  	Creation of the Preserve</strong>  	In 2001, Forterra, the City of Tukwila and local citizen group Friends  of the Hill formed a partnership to work towards the preservation of a  10.5 acre parcel slated for industrial development. The land was  successfully acquired in 2004 by the Forterra (then Cascade Land  Conservancy) and the City of Tukwila. In September 2010, after many  years of hard work by volunteers, the Duwamish Hill Preserve was  officially opened to the public. The preserve now includes an outdoor  classroom area, established trail and continued restoration  opportunities for volunteers. The Duwamish Hill Preserve is managed as a  public open space preserve dedicated to the conservation and  enhancement of its rich Native American cultural history, ecological  importance and community impact. Funding for acquisition and restoration  of this property has been supported by grants from many generous  contributors.<br /><span style=""""""""></span><strong><br /><span style=""""""""></span>  	Natural and Cultural History </strong> 	Due to its elevated position above the Duwamish River, the Hill offered  a vantage point from which Native Americans could watch for incoming  groups and communicate with fellow tribe members along the Duwamish  River Valley. Additionally, the Hill is associated with the southern  Puget Sound Salish oral tradition as the key location in the stories  collectively known as the &ldquo;Epic of the Winds.&rdquo;<br /><span style=""""""""></span><br /><span style=""""""""></span>  	The hill from which the preserve gets its name is a glacial remnant and  within the preserve many species of flora and fauna that are rarely  seen along the banks of the Duwamish River can be found.<br /><span style=""""""""></span><br /><span style=""""""""></span><strong>  	Restoration</strong>  	Thousands of volunteers have contributed countless hours of work  removing invasive weed and planting native trees and shrubs. The Friends  of the Hill make up a core group of dedicated volunteers that host  monthly restoration work parties at the Hill and offer local community  members a chance to contribute to the restoration of this amazing  preserve.
